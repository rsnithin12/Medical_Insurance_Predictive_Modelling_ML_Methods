# Medical_Insurance_Predictive_Modelling_ML_Methods
<p>Predicting healthcare expenses accurately is
crucial for a wide range of stakeholders and healthcare
institutions. The healthcare industry generates massive volumes
of data about patients, symptoms, and diagnoses, but this data
has yet to be thoroughly studied to provide insight into patient
healthcare costs. Machine learning (ML) may help enhance
policy wording efficiency in the insurance industry, and ML
algorithms are especially beneficial in healthcare for projecting
high-cost, high-need patient bills. A computational intelligence
technique is used to estimate healthcare insurance expenditures
using machine learning algorithms. It is difficult to choose a
single regression model for predicting health-care costs, thus we
build an algorithm that uses multiple regression models and
calculates the accuracy. The stochastic gradient boosting
technique achieves an accuracy of 88.98%</p>
